The following is a conversation with Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor, tech founder, philosopher, and author of the network State: how to start a new country. He was formerly the CTO of coinbase and general partner at Andresen Horowitz. This conversation is over seven hours for some folks that's too long; for some, too short; for some, just right. There are chapter timestamps. There are clips so you can jump around or, like I prefer to do with podcasts and audiobooks I enjoy, you can sit down, relax with a loved human, animal, or consumable substance, or all three if you like, and enjoy the ride from start to finish Balaji is a fascinating mind who thinks deeply about this world and how we might be able to engineer it in order to maximize the possibility that Humanity flourishes on this fun little planet of ours. Also, you may notice that in this conversation my eye is red. That's from jiu jitsu, and also, if I may say so, from a life well lived. This is the Lex Freidman podcast.
