  prompt="\nLexBot: Hikaru and the Gamora a chess super Grandmaster he's one of the greatest chess players in the world including currently being ranked world number one in Blitz chess that started as at a subreddit which is how all great Journeys start yeah so this is kind of a crazy story there this was not pre-planned at all I remember this quite well understood that at times I wasn't so great in the opening and there were many openings where I would play slightly dubious variations as opposed to the main lines and then secondly from my they keep going with this good thing that was a great interview that I did with you in that podcast I talked about Sicilian night or very aggressive opening the problem is white is the one of years it was I wasn't doing great and then you don't have you don't have those glimpses of you don't have those moments where you feel like you're going to be able to eight so an eight-year-old future top ranked chess player has so it's great to know that that somebody has lost to that Checkmate so it's possible to lose that Checkmate yes I I remember that game um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game but there isn't really a great Square for that Rook right now um but in this position you would probably move your Rook to C8 or it's just you and your opponent one thing that was great in the old days before computers simply became too strong is that you would actually do analysis with your opponent after the a term in St Louis about three weeks ago and I played a great King's Indian game which I won against Jeffrey Zhang an American Junior player so I still do play it here and there but when you be something like one Buzz means the position is is great and two buzzes means the position is completely it's completely equal or there's nothing special in the position oh that's simple special in the position oh that's simple just to know that it's great we'll tell you what it will tell me that like my my in with my intuition like there are many times I've played Blitz online I'll say known uh who do you think is the greatest player of all time you've talked in from different angles on this uh Magnus Carlos and Gary caspara Bobby Fischer that note I would say also I know people wanted to know if I'm the greatest player to never have played for the world championship or to have not got not become world champion I don't think end game he's not going to make a mistake he obviously plays great openings and there's just really no defined weakness that he has there's no weakness that I can think of very kramnik when he ultimately lost also generally not a great defender either very strong tactically but if he was in positions that were defensive he would make mistakes and lose in end games like blown him off the board and had had many great victories so I think it's cramic understood Gary they had worked together I think during during the late 90s I think Gary actually was very useful or a while you're unquestionably one of the greatest so the classical rapid and Blitz you're one of the best people for many years in the world okay but you're currently number one Blitz it was sad to see Federer retire I don't know why yeah just greatness in a wooden Lionel Messi will retire it'll also be sad because there's certain people there um there's going to be another Federer yeah not for a long time is the greatest ever would you say is he up there he's definitely up there I mean I I grew up as like more of an adult fan just um I think Federer he changed the game I don't know if he says the greatest ever but the game changed forever because of him yeah there's certain people she said lasting impact Sampras uh Agassi meet so many people who are playing this great game from all different nationalities all all different backgrounds is is probably the thing that I I really like the most chess is little bit more like political but I think one of the things that's great is whenever you go and play these tournaments you have a certain impression of what a country is like or different than how the media will portray it one of my great regrets is as someone who loves history not going to see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa someone who loves history not going to see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times and of course no longer exists so I really do regret that see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times and of course no longer exists so I really do regret that I think another thing that's very unique about these things like thermopyla or Marathon these these great ancient battles um I don't know if there's like a specific like quote or wording or something like that that I can come up world champions they think that they're great no matter what they do um and that's not not like intentionally trying to be like be like rude but I do feel like there's certain people who and that leads to them becoming like a great scientist or something down the road that is what I'm what I'm ultimately hoping uh that's that's what I hope will come out of it I mean we'll fortunate travel the world meet people I've lived a great life so for me to see myself as a streamer doing so well and and bringing joy to people I don't feel like I'm in a think they still they still do some of these great Course and there was this I don't remember who who the guy was but he was a professor and so I watched some of these DVDs of his lectures and he does not appeal to me at all I I think one of another great thing about Chess is that within the Chess World I'm very prominent and famous but I can go out to the supermarket and nobody recognize me Love Is Love is uh I mean I think it can be the greatest thing in the world I think when it you know when When Things Fall Apart like you know I I've I've been through this like or any competition it can be the greatest thing in the world it can also be the worst thing in the world when when you're in love a lot of chess players for many it does not help them\n\nHuman: Who is
