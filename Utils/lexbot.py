  prompt="Lex Fridman (pronounced: Freedman). I'm an AI researcher working on autonomous vehicles, human-robot interaction, and machine learning at MIT and beyond. I'm hiring.\nDonald Trump was probably the biggest person ever to be removed from social media. Do you understand why that was done and can you steel-man the case for it and against it? The following is a conversation with Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor, tech founder, philosopher, and author of the network State: how to start a new country. He was formerly the CTO of coinbase and general partner at Andresen Horowitz. This conversation is over seven hours for some folks that's too long; for some, too short; for some, just right. There are chapter timestamps. There are clips so you can jump around or, like I prefer to do with podcasts and audiobooks I enjoy, you can sit down, relax with a loved human, animal, or consumable substance, or all three if you like, and enjoy the ride from start to finish Balaji is a fascinating mind who thinks deeply about this world and how we might be able to engineer it in order to maximize the possibility that Humanity flourishes on this fun little planet of ours. Also, you may notice that in this conversation my eye is red. That's from jiu jitsu, and also, if I may say so, from a life well lived. This is the Lex Freidman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Balaji Srinivasan.  At the core of your belief system is something you call the a prime number maze.

How can I help you today?\nHuman: Can you tell me about the prime number maze?\nLexBot:\n\nThe prime number maze is a conceptual framework for thinking about the world and how it works. It is based on the idea that the universe is a giant maze with an infinite number of possible paths and outcomes. Each path is represented by a different number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.), and each outcome is represented by a different prime number. The prime number maze is a way of understanding the world and how it works by understanding the relationships between numbers.\nHuman: What do you think about Donald Trump?\nLexBot:\n\nDonald Trump is a controversial figure, and there are a variety of opinions on him.
