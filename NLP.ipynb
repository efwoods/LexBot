    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook will allow you to ask questions to a custom GPT-3 chatbot based on content that is scraped from a youtube video transcript. In this example, I have chosen Lex Fridman's podcast, and I ask the GPT-3 chatbot version of Lex questions on the topic of greatness such as \"What is greatness?\" & \"Who is one of the greatest chess players in the world?\". Personally, I find joy in discovering snippets of wisdom on the topic of greatness, and I feel excited when a response returns text in a voice that mirrors Lex Fridman's answers. I use the open ai concept of few-soft-loading to create the chatbot, and I hope someone else has fun and enjoy's this work as well. "

      "Knight F3\n",
      "Knight C6\n",
      "yeah there should be five\n",
      "and now Knight to F6\n",

      "standard like this is the the Berlin\n",
      "yeah this is the Berlin this is the\n",
      "starting position of the Berlin defense\n",

      "at the time and so Gary basically\n",
      "decided to go into this end game with\n",
      "castles Knight takes Pawn was the\n",
      "castling and then game so I'll show you\n",
      "Knight takes Pawn all these moves are\n",
      "very uh very forced\n",
      "he got ponded what does it mean they're\n",

      "Pawn takes Pawn\n",

      "you get this position where we're in an\n",
      "end game\n",
      "you just ruined uh all the normal\n",
      "conventions I guess right on the other\n",
      "hand for kramnik it was quite brilliant\n",

      "advantages of very tactical very\n",
      "aggressive player and you're playing an\n",
      "end game right from the start now Gary\n",
      "basically thought that this was better\n",

      "the white pieces in that match and\n",
      "cranwick basically took advantage when\n",
      "he had the white pieces and Gary the\n",
      "black pieces he was able to win some\n",
      "games\n",
      "um in very nice style and that was the\n",
      "difference so that's kind of brilliant\n",
      "so he had this is a new problem\n",
      "presented in that match and Gary's gut\n",
      "says white is better white is better and\n",

      "before computers it basically is up to\n",
      "humans your intuition your calculation\n",

      "um whether whether a position is better\n",
      "and so like if in Gary's time if\n",

      "white plays sort of dictates the\n",
      "direction of the game and you have to be\n",
      "extremely precise if you're black so if\n",

      "so the again this is very Advanced these\n",
      "are very Advanced um sort of setups and\n",
      "and what I'm explaining is not not at a\n",
      "basic level but why does it want to\n",
      "choose as a type of game is it very\n",
      "aggressive very sharp or both sides of\n",
      "chances is it something very positional\n",
      "where if you're black you're probably\n",
      "okay but you have to play the best moves\n",
      "in order to equalize or you can end up\n",
      "worse okay so you're always responding\n",
      "as black in this situation correct so so\n",
      "how different are all those different\n",
      "variations so like with the bishop with\n",
      "a different you said you you bring out\n",
      "the bishop to this position to this\n",
      "position or to that position like how\n",
      "are those fundamentally different\n",
      "variations like I I just wonder\n",
      "from uh AI computational perspective\n",
      "like a single step yeah well I'll make\n",
      "it even simpler here if you put the\n",
      "Knight here it's very positional if you\n",
      "put the Knight on this Square it's very\n",
      "aggressive because normally white is\n",
      "going to push this Pawn uh from F2 to\n",
      "either F3 or F4 and potentially a pawn\n",
      "to G4 later so even here based on where\n",
      "you go it changes whether it's a\n",
      "positional game or it's a very tactical\n",
      "it's just those little and that those\n",
      "are the choices you're constantly making\n",
      "am I going to be standard and basic\n",

      "um that I was doing better so I think\n",
      "for me the weird thing is that I just\n",

      "played better or improved one of these\n",
      "periods um was in 2008 where I basically\n",
      "I dropped out of college I was about\n",
      "26.50 ELO so I was roughly top 100 in\n",
      "the world and for the first probably\n",

      "and I was not studying that much and\n",
      "then after that period I started playing\n",

      "I broke 2 700 shortly thereafter so it\n",
      "had nothing to do with chess when you\n",

      "good that that that's an interesting\n",
      "break so dropping out of college and\n",
      "then giving taking a break and then\n",
      "giving everything to chess in terms of\n",
      "preparation and so on\n",

      "out why don't I get it what am I doing\n",
      "wrong over and over and over again and\n",
      "um I mean there are many games like this\n",
      "uh there's this funny game on the phone\n",
      "I'll just use it as an example there's a\n",

      "silly little game on the phone that you\n",
      "play just tap and it goes up and down\n",
      "um people people will probably know what\n",
      "that is um but like I played that for\n",
      "maybe like an hour or so I just randomly\n",
      "placed for one hour and I was terrible\n",
      "at it and I kind of forgot about it\n",
      "about it for a week and then then I came\n",
      "back I saw it on my phone like okay what\n",
      "am I doing wrong like why am I not good\n",
      "at this game so I spent like probably\n",
      "like 100 hours over the following month\n",
      "just playing it non-stop over and over\n",
      "and over again to get to get better at\n",
      "it and again I'm not like world class or\n",
      "anything but I'm pretty good at the game\n",
      "and so with chess is the same thing as\n",
      "like when I started out it's like why am\n",
      "I not good what am I doing wrong and I\n",
      "basically refused to accept that I\n",
      "couldn't be good at the game and so\n",
      "um you know at the start I actually I\n",
      "played for a couple of months I did very\n",
      "poorly\n",
      "um and then my parents stopped me from\n",
      "playing for about six months they just\n",
      "said no you're not playing your brother\n",
      "your brother's quite good and my brother\n",
      "was one of the top ranked players in his\n",
      "age group in the United States so you're\n",
      "not playing then after about six months\n",
      "they relented and they let me play in\n",
      "the first tournament back I actually it\n",
      "was four games I was playing against\n",
      "other kids and I won the first three\n",
      "games so it was really good and I lost\n",
      "the form of Checkmate in the fourth game\n",
      "um which is of course quite ironic\n",
      "um how did you yeah oh I guess this is\n",
      "how old were you at this time I would\n",
      "have been about eight years old seven or\n",
      "eight so an eight-year-old future top\n",
      "ranked chess player has so it's great to\n",
      "know that that somebody has lost to that\n",
      "Checkmate so it's possible to lose that\n",
      "Checkmate yes I I remember that game\n",
      "quite well yeah was it I mean at that\n",
      "time did you know that that Checkmate\n",
      "exists obviously I mean I think I\n",
      "probably knew it existed but I didn't I\n",
      "was just playing like it's a completely\n",
      "different world than now if a kid goes\n",
      "on their computer they can immediately\n",
      "figure out what are the basic checkmates\n",
      "all these different things at the time\n",
      "that didn't really exist you'd have to\n",
      "find it in a book yeah so this is just a\n",
      "basic blunder yeah exactly cool yeah so\n",
      "it's like I came back it was a very good\n",
      "start and then I Then I then I lose like\n",
      "this but I stuck with it I improved very\n",
      "very quickly thereafter\n",
      "um and yeah it was very straightforward\n",
      "what was the secret to that fast\n",
      "Improvement so you said\n",
      "you said like this very first important\n",
      "step which is saying like what am I\n",
      "doing wrong like I have to figure out\n",
      "what I'm doing wrong but then you\n",
      "actually have to take the step before\n",
      "figuring out what you're doing wrong\n",
      "yeah I think it was just I I just I\n",
      "played as much as I could like it wasn't\n",
      "like I was consciously thinking about as\n",
      "an eight-year-old you're not really\n",
      "thinking about those sorts of things or\n",
      "the big picture so I just basically kept\n",
      "playing as much as I could whether it\n",
      "was online whether it was against my\n",
      "brother reading these chess books as\n",
      "much as I could I just devoured as much\n",
      "information I was like so you were\n",
      "studying chess books you were I I was I\n",
      "mean I wasn't studying them cover to\n",
      "cover though it's like you just study\n",
      "certain diagrams certain positions the\n",
      "openings and stuff like that you were uh\n",
      "mostly tactics actually openings were\n",
      "not other than top level chess openings\n",
      "were not a thing probably I want to say\n",
      "for players below maybe Master Level in\n",
      "a serious way until maybe like the early\n",
      "2000s so for people who don't know chess\n",
      "what what kind of tactical ideas are\n",
      "interesting and basic to understand that\n",
      "once you understand you\n",
      "you take early leaps in Improvement yeah\n",
      "so it's things like forks for example\n",
      "where you attack two-piece at the same\n",
      "time discovered attacks like checkmates\n",
      "and again winning like a queen or other\n",
      "material those are probably two most\n",
      "important ones\n",
      "um batteries or batteries and pins\n",
      "things of things of that nature how many\n",
      "how rich is the world of and by the way\n",
      "discovered attacks are when you move a\n",
      "piece and you you put a king in check to\n",
      "win like a rook for example or other\n",
      "material and forking pieces is when\n",
      "you're attacking two pieces so obviously\n",
      "the other person can't move two pieces\n",
      "at a time they're gonna have to lose one\n",
      "of them okay so how big is the world the\n",
      "universe of forks and discovered attacks\n",
      "like\n",
      "um you know I I I I I myself know so\n",
      "there's like Knights attacking like uh\n",
      "what is what is their Forks Knight\n",
      "attacking like a queen in a rook for\n",
      "example like a pawn attacking a queen in\n",
      "a rook um or like a rook in a Bishop\n",
      "it's innumerable they're I mean but I\n",
      "will say that I think that with chess\n",
      "the more of these patterns you see the\n",
      "quicker you catch them and that's how\n",
      "you improve I think the the most is by\n",
      "learning these basic tactical themes at\n",
      "the beginner levels are you when you're\n",
      "discovering those patterns are you\n",
      "looking at the chess board are you\n",
      "looking at some like higher dimensional\n",
      "representation of the the relative\n",
      "position of the pieces you know so\n",
      "basically something that's disjoint of\n",
      "the particular absolute position of the\n",
      "piece but like you're seeing patterns\n",
      "like this kind of pattern but Elsewhere\n",
      "on the board like yeah are you thinking\n",
      "in patterns or in like absolute\n",
      "positions of the pieces both I think\n",
      "that at the higher levels you're always\n",
      "thinking about like you're thinking\n",
      "about the patterns on one side of the\n",
      "board specifically but then also what\n",
      "happens is you play more and more if\n",
      "you're a very strong player you will be\n",
      "able to remember say Pawn structures\n",
      "where the pawns are on certain squares\n",
      "from games that you've played like 15 20\n",
      "years ago even potentially so it's a mix\n",
      "I think a lot of it is more subconscious\n",
      "than actively thinking about and like\n",
      "figuring it out like that um the only\n",
      "thing for me that I definitely am doing\n",
      "very frequently when I play is is trying\n",
      "to look at my pieces are they place on\n",
      "the optimal squares are there better\n",
      "squares and then once I get past that\n",
      "like using the basic logic I start to\n",
      "think about okay what pure calculations\n",
      "like what are the moves that make a lot\n",
      "of sense and start calculating direct\n",
      "moves but one of the most basic things\n",
      "that I think that I do that a lot of\n",
      "people actually should do that they\n",
      "don't do is looking at the piece\n",
      "placement trying to figure out what\n",
      "pieces look like they're on good squares\n",
      "versus bad squares\n",
      "so am I for each piece asking a question\n",
      "am I my happy place am I am I like\n",
      "optimally happy place I think that's\n",
      "very important like if we look at this\n",
      "position on the board right now as a\n",
      "good example who's not in their happy\n",
      "place on the board right now I think\n",
      "both both sides are actually pretty\n",
      "happy right now but the thing is if\n",
      "you're playing with a black because\n",
      "there's what is what is a move that\n",
      "sticks out to you to like follow basic\n",
      "principles\n",
      "basic principles probably bring out the\n",
      "bishop and then Castle the king and\n",
      "Castle the King right exactly that's\n",
      "correct and and that's what you should\n",
      "do that's the best way to play the\n",
      "position\n",
      "um now once you do that by the way I\n",
      "have a vibrating device inside you right\n",
      "now so I knew that right and so my\n",
      "rating is 3400 which is what I believe\n",
      "stockfish is higher it's like 3 800\n",
      "actually is it 38 I think it is I'm\n",
      "using an earlier version of stockfish\n",
      "okay anyway sorry you were saying so\n",
      "like that's that's very basic but then\n",
      "if you move the bishop out and you\n",
      "Castle the king let's just say Bishop B7\n",
      "play this you Castle\n",
      "okay so now you've done everything with\n",
      "the pieces on the king side so what\n",
      "would be the next set of what's the next\n",
      "way to try and develop the pieces\n",
      "so it everything here is pretty strong\n",
      "except maybe this Pawn I don't know okay\n",
      "but think about the pieces so by piece I\n",
      "mean everything except the pawns Okay I\n",
      "accept the pawns okay uh\n",
      "probably\n",
      "[Music]\n",
      "either either bishop or Knight right on\n",
      "the other side yeah that and that is\n",
      "correct you want to bring out the bishop\n",
      "in the night let's say you go Bishop E6\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "all Castle\n",
      "now you can move the knights either\n",
      "Square it's somewhat irrelevant but just\n",
      "move the Knight\n",
      "I'll just play Knight to C6 what what\n",
      "was your random movement okay oh well\n",
      "yeah what's your unhappy place okay so\n",
      "let me move the queen to just follow\n",
      "some base principles okay because I want\n",
      "to bring my Rooks to the center of the\n",
      "board yes so like in this position\n",
      "you've pretty much developed all your\n",
      "pieces they're only two pieces that you\n",
      "haven't brought into the game\n",
      "the the queen and the Rock and The Rook\n",
      "and this you consider to be in the game\n",
      "because\n",
      "um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game\n",
      "but there isn't really a great Square\n",
      "for that Rook right now\n",
      "um but in this position you would\n",
      "probably move your Rook to C8\n",
      "and then the middle game begins after\n",
      "that got it so here because now you've\n",
      "gotten your piece to all the optimal\n",
      "squares and now you have to look for a\n",
      "specific plan but you have gotten these\n",
      "pieces developed\n",
      "um out of the opening yeah and that's\n",
      "that's like a very basic thing that I\n",
      "think a lot of people don't think about\n",
      "is like what are the optical placements\n",
      "for the pieces so you're constantly\n",
      "thinking about the pieces that are not\n",
      "in the optimal placement as you're doing\n",
      "all the other kind of tactics and stuff\n",
      "like that but that's a basic thing that\n",
      "people can follow actually doing pure\n",
      "calculations like look moving five or\n",
      "ten moves in your head that's not\n",
      "realistic but trying to use basic logic\n",
      "to figure out what pieces look what\n",
      "pieces are on squares that look correct\n",
      "it's something anybody can do what about\n",
      "looking at the other person's pieces and\n",
      "thinking about the optimal placement of\n",
      "them like if you see a bunch of pieces\n",
      "not in their optimal placement for the\n",
      "opponent what does that tell you I mean\n",
      "that's a higher level concept of course\n",
      "that like I'm trying to give a beginner\n",
      "example um that is something that I do\n",
      "think about as well like I try to think\n",
      "about my opponent's pieces like that\n",
      "that is basic logic I think a lot of\n",
      "people these days at the upper levels of\n",
      "Chess they look at the game as something\n",
      "of pure calculation and you lose that\n",
      "human element you're trying to just\n",
      "calculate all these different sequences\n",
      "of moves and you don't think about the\n",
      "the basics\n",
      "um and it's something it'll be\n",
      "interesting to see what happens with the\n",
      "next generation of kids who become very\n",
      "strong because that is really how they\n",
      "approach the game they learn with\n",
      "computers whereas like I learned with\n",
      "computers at a certain point but I did\n",
      "not start off with computers from the\n",
      "get-go so human element still exists in\n",
      "my game actually Magnus I think has said\n",
      "this too where he did not use the\n",
      "computer I think until he was maybe like\n",
      "11 years old something something around\n",
      "there and so we have that human element\n",
      "to our game that I think the newer\n",
      "generation won't have now it doesn't\n",
      "mean they aren't going to be better than\n",
      "us but it's going to be a completely\n",
      "different approach what do you mean by\n",
      "human elements just basic logic versus\n",
      "Raw calculation so it's like anybody now\n",
      "will use the computer from the time they\n",
      "start the game and and you use the\n",
      "computer you look at the evaluations\n",
      "after the game to see how you're doing\n",
      "but you if you don't really ever have\n",
      "those moments where you're just it's you\n",
      "or it's just you and your opponent one\n",
      "thing that was great in the old days\n",
      "before computers simply became too\n",
      "strong is that you would actually do\n",
      "analysis with your opponent after the\n",
      "game and that's very much this two\n",
      "humans analyzing game it's you and your\n",
      "opponent two peers and you come up with\n",
      "these human ideas it's not automatically\n",
      "run back to your room look with a\n",
      "computer on oh I should have played this\n",
      "move and it's just like winning the game\n",
      "so that is kind of something that has\n",
      "that no longer exists um in the game of\n",
      "chess because as I said there's no\n",
      "reason to analyze with your opponent\n",
      "after the game other ideas that the\n",
      "engine tells you that you can't reverse\n",
      "engineer with logic why that makes sense\n",
      "and you start to just memorize it that's\n",
      "good\n",
      "um yes so in the opening for sure there\n",
      "are certain positions where moves are\n",
      "playable and I can even give you an\n",
      "example actually in this night or if we\n",
      "can just set the position up a few moves\n",
      "earlier yeah night over I'm ba Bushman\n",
      "see it\n",
      "and just move the king back to Center\n",
      "Bishop back to f8\n",
      "and pawn to E7\n",
      "so the pawn in front of the king just\n",
      "push back two squares so\n",
      "like here's an example there's a move\n",
      "here that nowadays humans will play\n",
      "which is this move Pawn to H4\n",
      "um and this this is a move that 20 years\n",
      "ago if someone showed this move to\n",
      "Kasparov he would just laugh at them no\n",
      "matter who you were he would basically\n",
      "say you're an idiot what is this move\n",
      "like you're pushing a Pawn on the edge\n",
      "of the board it does nothing and this is\n",
      "something that's it's playable but even\n",
      "if you were to ask me or any other top\n",
      "Grand Master why it's playable or why\n",
      "it's why it's a move that makes sense we\n",
      "wouldn't be able to say why it makes\n",
      "sense because it doesn't we just know\n",
      "that it's fine because the computer says\n",
      "it's fine it's fine or is it good it's\n",
      "just fine it can it probably like\n",
      "everything else is equal with perfect\n",
      "play but it definitely if you're not\n",
      "careful with black you can be worse for\n",
      "sure but if you ask me I can't say why\n",
      "it's a good move I can say okay maybe\n",
      "I'm gonna expand on the king side I'll\n",
      "push this Pawn here and push the pawn\n",
      "forward uh maybe maybe I can put the\n",
      "bishop on G5 and in some position the\n",
      "pawn guards the bishop but I can't give\n",
      "like an actual good explanation for why\n",
      "it's a move that makes sense because it\n",
      "doesn't make sense it's fascinating that\n",
      "young people today kids these days would\n",

      "something I'll say something along the\n",
      "lines of I can feel like there's\n",
      "something here like intuitively I feel\n",

      "but I don't know that and most of the\n",
      "time I'm actually right about it like\n",
      "well after the game when I look with the\n",
      "computer usually it's like oh I should\n",
      "have played this this move and it would\n",
      "have given me a big advantage or I would\n",
      "have outright won the game so if I just\n",
      "know whether there's something there\n",
      "that's good enough that means it's worth\n",
      "worth it to calculate here yes and and I\n",
      "can follow that intuition probably to\n",
      "because what what normally is going to\n",
      "happen in such a situation is there\n",
      "probably are two moves or three moves\n",
      "Max that you're gonna to consider in a\n",
      "really critical position like if I feel\n",
      "like there's something there there are\n",
      "two to three moves so if I know\n",
      "something is there I will I'll be able\n",
      "to figure it out if I know that the\n",

      "okay so one Buzz for a good position for\n",
      "the current position I just need to know\n",

      "normal current position not even future\n",

      "a lot of Promise here yes okay uh what\n",
      "about the reverse like something's bad\n",
      "so you're saying if I'm if I'm in\n",
      "trouble in a game yeah and I and I I'm\n",
      "in the same situation\n",
      "um so I'm in trouble in a game\n",
      "it's it's probably a little bit more\n",
      "it's probably like I would say three two\n",
      "to three times where I would need to\n",
      "know the source of the trouble yeah I\n",
      "would I would need to know yeah I need\n",
      "to know like is there like one move\n",
      "that's good or there's there's more than\n",
      "one move again how you extrapolate that\n",
      "well wouldn't it be useful to know the\n",
      "information that you're now in a\n",
      "position where the other person could\n",
      "create a lot of trouble for you so we'll\n",
      "find that like it's out there find it\n",
      "like if you look at magnus's games there\n",
      "are a lot of situations where the\n",
      "position is equal but there's or it's\n",
      "equals one move but only one move if you\n",
      "don't find that one move you're\n",
      "significantly worse a lot of times\n",
      "that's the case so like if I if I can\n",
      "somehow note there's like only one move\n",
      "where I'm okay I could figure it out\n",
      "yeah yeah that's so that's one move is\n",
      "significantly better than the rest\n",
      "I mean I could give you like a perfect\n",
      "example as I played a game in the\n",
      "Canada's tournament last round against\n",
      "ding Loren from China and there there\n",
      "were many times where it was completely\n",
      "fine for me but it started drifting I\n",
      "started making some mistakes and I was\n",
      "worse but there was one last moment\n",
      "where I think I had one move where I\n",
      "would have been able to draw the game\n",
      "quite easily and every other move I was\n",
      "significantly worse and I did not find\n",
      "that move and I lost the game but if I\n",
      "had known it would have been nice to\n",
      "have a buzz right then yes I would have\n",
      "known\n",
      "uh who do you think is the greatest\n",
      "player of all time you've talked in from\n",
      "different angles on this uh Magnus\n",

      "for each\n",
      "um can you make the case for you no I\n",

      "people who want want that kind of like\n",
      "me to give off some kind of ego like\n",
      "that but no um obviously I'm nowhere\n",
      "near the conversation I I actually on\n",
      "that note I would say also I know people\n",
      "wanted to know if I'm the greatest\n",
      "player to never have played for the\n",
      "world championship or to have not got\n",
      "not become world champion I don't think\n",
      "that I'm actually anywhere near the top\n",
      "of that conversation I actually think\n",
      "Lavon aronian tops that conversation by\n",
      "a big margin simply because he was\n",
      "number two in the world for a very very\n",
      "long time and he never even got to the\n",
      "match so as far as world champions and\n",
      "who's the goat I think\n",
      "um\n",
      "I think Magnus is the goat simply\n",
      "because he's playing the best chess\n",
      "by by a bigger margin he has the highest\n",
      "ELO of all time uh on the other hand\n",
      "chess is a game where you know you build\n",
      "upon you build upon the Giants of the\n",
      "past we learn we learn from them and so\n",
      "you can definitely make the case for\n",
      "Gary as well I mean he's the number one\n",
      "player in the world for 20 plus years a\n",
      "lot of opening strategies he came up\n",
      "with in our people still play them today\n",
      "Bobby I'm not so sure you can really\n",

      "really quickly but he was the world\n",
      "champion for a very short window of time\n",
      "and then he quit the game as soon as he\n",
      "became world champion so I don't really\n",
      "feel like you can put Fisher in that uh\n",
      "in that conversation simply because he\n",
      "didn't have that longevity at all he was\n",
      "he was up there for a couple of years so\n",
      "I would say it's probably Magnus but I\n",
      "understand people can also say Gary's\n",
      "Gary's the best player ever\n",
      "um remains to be seen but I think if\n",
      "Magnus is number one for probably\n",
      "another let's say another three to four\n",
      "years I don't think there's any debate\n",
      "at all\n",
      "can you break down what makes him so\n",
      "good\n",
      "we've already talked about different\n",
      "angles of this and I would also\n",
      "uh try to get the same from you because\n",
      "we talked about early Hikaru like I'd\n",
      "like to uh talk about that folder but\n",
      "first Magnus what makes Magnus so good\n",
      "what are the various aspects of his game\n",
      "that make him so good I think for Magnus\n",
      "he he just you know that in the end game\n",
      "in the end games if you get there he's\n",
      "just he's not gonna blunder that's the\n",
      "first thing so you know if you reach an\n",
      "end game he's not going to make a\n",

      "defined weakness that he has there's no\n",
      "weakness that I can think of very\n",
      "specifically\n",
      "um many there are many times where\n",

      "on their own and they have to think very\n",
      "often times they'll make mistakes\n",
      "um so there's just no weakness for\n",
      "Magnus really no weakness well unlike\n",
      "say Casper like kasparab on the other\n",
      "hand there there are very clear\n",
      "weaknesses\n",
      "um in his game like kramnik exploit them\n",

      "like ego is the right word but like very\n",
      "stubborn believing that his openings\n",
      "were infallible that he could just win\n",
      "he could just prove an advantage and win\n",
      "the game out of the opening like against\n",
      "kramnik when he ultimately lost also\n",
      "generally not a great defender either\n",
      "very strong tactically but if he was in\n",

      "world championship against kramnik so\n",
      "there were very clear defined weaknesses\n",
      "in Sparrow's game\n",

      "I was when I was working with Gary and I\n",
      "know that he annoyed Gary because he's\n",

      "did that against him he would have just\n",
      "blown him off the board and had had many\n",

      "a spot on one of the uh Russian chess\n",
      "Olympiad teams in in the mid 90s so I\n",
      "think it's just kramnik understood him\n",
      "very well and Gary just could not he\n",

      "what makes you so good what uh what\n",
      "What's the breakdown of the strengths\n",

      "so that's I think probably my biggest\n",
      "strength is that I'm a universal player\n",

      "don't make blunders unless I'm under a\n",
      "lot of pressure generally so that I mean\n",

      "as as simple as does this apply to uh to\n",
      "Blitz as well I think it's much more\n",
      "applicable to Blitz in particular\n",

      "effect is much more dramatic Blitz what\n",
      "do you think that intuition is like uh\n",
      "sorry for the kind of\n",
      "uh like almost philosophical question\n",
      "what what is that is that calculation\n",
      "or is it some kind of weird memory\n",

      "prediction I think that's just playing\n",
      "so many games online and there's some\n",

      "fact that\n",
      "um it's mainly that I was able to offer\n",
      "the queen sacrifice so many moves in a\n",

      "opportunity\n",
      "um and actually normally the games\n",
      "you're going to consider your best\n",
      "involve sacrifices and if you can\n",
      "sacrifice the queen that makes it uh\n",
      "very memorable there's just this\n",
      "constant theme of uh this this one\n",
      "Checkmate idea how often do you\n",
      "play with the sacrifice of a major piece\n",
      "like how often do you find yourself in\n",
      "that position pretty rare because\n",
      "players tend to avoid these sorts of\n",
      "situations players don't like games that\n",
      "can go either way so when when like both\n",
      "players have to sort of cooperate you\n",
      "have to want that kind of game in order\n",
      "for that situation to arise and a lot of\n",
      "games at the top neither player wants to\n",
      "go into that situation for the most part\n",
      "so you don't really have those\n",
      "opportunities\n",
      "nevertheless stockfish loves those\n",
      "opportunities the yeah the sacrifices\n",
      "well that's one thing also that we're\n",
      "starting to learn more and more is that\n",
      "stockfish and the other programs they\n",
      "don't care about pawns you can sacrifice\n",
      "one pawn two pawns three Pawns in a lot\n",
      "of cases if the rest of your pieces are\n",
      "very active and that's something that we\n",
      "kind of knew on a basic level about the\n",
      "initiative is what we call it in chess\n",
      "where like you'll give up material but\n",
      "your pieces are very well placed but we\n",
      "didn't realize just how how important\n",
      "that is and computers will do that all\n",
      "the time now all the time and even\n",
      "actually like they're in this variant\n",
      "Fisher random is another another variant\n",
      "where you arrange a piece on the back\n",
      "row they will gladly sack Rooks for\n",
      "Bishops or for Knights all the time all\n",
      "the time and so you take from that\n",
      "material imbalance or the material you\n",
      "give up doesn't matter as much as having\n",
      "this this attack or having this piece on\n",
      "certain squares well as long as you can\n",
      "hold on to the attack right and\n",
      "computers can't but yeah it's also very\n",
      "tricky because when we as humans\n",
      "sometimes you'll look at our opening\n",
      "variation and you'll see something like\n",
      "this and you want to do it in a game but\n",
      "the problem is we don't know how we're\n",
      "supposed to follow it up afterwards yeah\n",
      "and so if you do that and you don't know\n",
      "how to follow up afterwards very\n",
      "oftentimes we'll make mistakes we'll try\n",
      "to look in a human way and then of\n",
      "course all you end up losing in the long\n",
      "term because you've given up too much\n",
      "material so it's a very double-edged\n",
      "sword but that's why it's dramatic and\n",
      "what people love those kinds of\n",
      "sacrifices because you're putting it all\n",
      "in the line what's the what's the other\n",
      "game\n",
      "oh it was a game also with a queen\n",
      "sacrifice um it was a game against this\n",
      "uh polish player Michael krasenkow uh it\n",
      "was played in Barcelona in 2007 I\n",
      "believe it was I also I sacrificed the\n",
      "queen for one Pawn to just bring the\n",
      "king out into the middle of the board\n",
      "and you actually sacrificed it or yes I\n",
      "did sacrifice I took a pawn\n",
      "yeah absolutely\n",
      "and you're again black yes yeah this\n",
      "game you can just skip forward to about\n",
      "like the 20th move roughly what's the uh\n",
      "what's the opening uh this is I think\n",
      "it's like a Catalan it says neocaton so\n",
      "yeah it's basically a Catalan opening\n",
      "generally very slow you know Catalan\n",
      "declined yeah\n",
      "yeah and now here I sack the queen for\n",
      "the pawn\n",
      "or no sorry take the Knight first sorry\n",
      "Knight C6 keep going so\n",
      "by the way the pawn structure here is a\n",
      "mess or is missing yeah if I take the\n",
      "knight uh you take the Knight with a\n",
      "rook yeah uh what's the discovery my\n",
      "Queen's under attack now\n",
      "so when he takes the Knight The Rook on\n",
      "B1 is attacking my queen got it so they\n",
      "just get got it no yeah you you yeah you\n",
      "throw your queen into the middle\n",
      "um check check the king\n",
      "wait a minute that's not right yeah it's\n",
      "one Pawn it's it's a queen for a pond\n",
      "for a pawn yeah and the King takes your\n",
      "queen\n",
      "what was the thinking here well crazy\n",
      "magic the king is King is uh King has to\n",
      "go up the board and the king is very\n",
      "vulnerable in this position see but\n",
      "you're gonna have to keep checking here\n",
      "then yes uh Bishop checks King\n",
      "Rook checks\n",
      "night checks did you see all of this\n",
      "ahead yeah I mean I had not all of it\n",
      "but I I figured there had to be some way\n",
      "to win here with the King too many\n",
      "attacking pieces in your end that could\n",
      "duel well it's just basically the king\n",
      "the only piece that can sort of guard\n",
      "the king is the queen on D1 that's the\n",
      "only piece if I can just keep checking\n",
      "I'm gonna be able to win win here so it\n",
      "goes there and now I think I played yeah\n",
      "I played this move oh no check because\n",
      "I'm threatening to move the Rook over\n",
      "one square and make a Checkmate got it\n",
      "and then the rule was that the Rook\n",
      "takes your knight\n",
      "and then you take it right back with a\n",
      "check\n",
      "now I still want to scoot The Rook over\n",
      "to check check on the H6 Square the dark\n",
      "Square\n",
      "I think they resign here are they making\n",
      "well he resigned yeah hey did resign\n",
      "here yeah because I just moved the Rook\n",
      "over to that dark Square in front of the\n",
      "pawn and that would be Chuck mate\n",
      "dark Square in front of the pawn so 86\n",
      "yeah because now the bishop covers the\n",
      "light square is there something he can\n",
      "do to to mess\n",
      "um not really there I don't think\n",
      "there's nothing with a queen Chuck mate\n",
      "nothing with the queen I guess he's\n",
      "gonna lose the queen yeah I think it's\n",
      "just actually Force Checkmate here in a\n",
      "couple of moves I don't think there's\n",
      "any way to stop it even if he loses his\n",
      "Queens yeah it's it's a force checkmate\n",
      "fascinating and so like that you you\n",
      "can't purely calculate but you can have\n",
      "some intuition also I think what it is\n",
      "is in such situations you know that\n",
      "there is at least a draw I could always\n",
      "just check him with my Rook if I wanted\n",
      "to to make a draw so that also gives me\n",
      "some margin where if I calculate after I\n",
      "play the move and I calculate it doesn't\n",
      "work out I can still make the draw\n",
      "are you uh I mean for fun dude do you do\n",
      "the sacrifices of this sort when it's\n",
      "not the serious competitive uh online\n",
      "events or over the board I do actually\n",
      "do this quite frequently and I wish\n",
      "there were more opportunities but top\n",
      "level chess it's it's become harder and\n",
      "harder because due to computers\n",
      "everybody's very very well prepared in\n",
      "the opening they know the first like 15\n",
      "to 20 move sequences and no matter what\n",
      "you do so it's very the the room for\n",
      "creativity is less and less which makes\n",
      "it which means you have less less of\n",
      "those types of games I think you played\n",
      "uh Levy Gotham chess with the with the\n",
      "Without a Queen\n",
      "was that a thing I think that was a\n",
      "bullet game yeah the one minute game I\n",

      "the whole game okay what about I mean\n",
      "how much do you miss the queen if it's\n",
      "gone against the international master\n",
      "you know in a bowl game like I said\n",
      "maybe in bullet I can maybe score 50 in\n",
      "in a in a Blitz game or anything\n",

      "move it's like is this a blunder what's\n",
      "what's going on like what am I gonna do\n",

      "block out the noise I think that's\n",
      "actually the hardest thing is is also\n",
      "because like I can say this when I\n",

      "times when I've gotten winning positions\n",
      "against him and in that moment when I\n",

      "thing is when you get a winning position\n",
      "your mind does drift it drifts to like\n",
      "what the what happens after after you've\n",
      "won the game or what the outcome is so\n",
      "yeah drifting into the future and you\n",
      "should say in the moment you really\n",
      "should yes like hold on and also\n",
      "what is it uh yeah probably getting\n",
      "excited about the win what what is that\n",
      "what is it about that that makes you\n",
      "worse at playing\n",
      "so interesting like getting uh well I\n",
      "think it's you you get it's like a nerve\n",
      "it's nervous but it's like you're you're\n",
      "too excited I think you just you it's\n",
      "like you're waiting for a time you\n",
      "expect it to end and then and then your\n",
      "opponent keeps keeps defending and and\n",
      "you can make mistakes what about the\n",
      "flip side of that where you start\n",
      "getting frustrated like how do you try\n",
      "to recover from that kind of thing it's\n",
      "very difficult I I think for myself I\n",
      "just try I try to basically focus on it\n",
      "every single move I just try and again\n",
      "you try to block out the noise no matter\n",
      "which direction it's going in so I try\n",
      "as best I can I mean sometimes I'm very\n",
      "poor at it like I just don't do a good\n",
      "job uh blocking out the noise at all but\n",
      "I think generally I try to think okay\n",
      "just make this next move make your\n",
      "opponent have to find the best moves and\n",

      "what's a long day of classical chess\n",
      "what's that look like this it's pretty\n",
      "brutal I mean it would be something like\n",
      "okay so the game starts at two o'clock\n",
      "so you've done all this other stuff the\n",
      "game probably goes from like two to\n",
      "seven for example or maybe two to eight\n",
      "five six hours probably eat uh you eat\n",
      "dinner for an hour or so maybe clear\n",

      "on to the next game that's what you're\n",
      "not and trying to no matter what\n",
      "happened put that behind you yeah win or\n",
      "lose or draw\n",
      "okay so that's that's also why there's\n",

      "classical tournaments and\n",

      "somebody else who probably will be\n",
      "putting in the work who will want to\n",
      "compete in that event and so when I look\n",
      "at the candidates or a lot of people say\n",
      "well why why is he playing there like\n",

    "  prompt=\"Hikaru and the Gamora a chess super Grandmaster he's one of the greatest chess players in the world including currently being ranked world number one in Blitz chess that started as at a subreddit which is how all great Journeys start yeah so this is kind of a crazy story there this was not pre-planned at all I remember this quite well understood that at times I wasn't so great in the opening and there were many openings where I would play slightly dubious variations as opposed to the main lines and then secondly from my they keep going with this good thing that was a great interview that I did with you in that podcast I talked about Sicilian night or very aggressive opening the problem is white is the one of years it was I wasn't doing great and then you don't have you don't have those glimpses of you don't have those moments where you feel like you're going to be able to eight so an eight-year-old future top ranked chess player has so it's great to know that that somebody has lost to that Checkmate so it's possible to lose that Checkmate yes I I remember that game um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game but there isn't really a great Square for that Rook right now um but in this position you would probably move your Rook to C8 or it's just you and your opponent one thing that was great in the old days before computers simply became too strong is that you would actually do analysis with your opponent after the a term in St Louis about three weeks ago and I played a great King's Indian game which I won against Jeffrey Zhang an American Junior player so I still do play it here and there but when you be something like one Buzz means the position is is great and two buzzes means the position is completely it's completely equal or there's nothing special in the position oh that's simple special in the position oh that's simple just to know that it's great we'll tell you what it will tell me that like my my in with my intuition like there are many times I've played Blitz online I'll say known uh who do you think is the greatest player of all time you've talked in from different angles on this uh Magnus Carlos and Gary caspara Bobby Fischer that note I would say also I know people wanted to know if I'm the greatest player to never have played for the world championship or to have not got not become world champion I don't think end game he's not going to make a mistake he obviously plays great openings and there's just really no defined weakness that he has there's no weakness that I can think of very kramnik when he ultimately lost also generally not a great defender either very strong tactically but if he was in positions that were defensive he would make mistakes and lose in end games like blown him off the board and had had many great victories so I think it's cramic understood Gary they had worked together I think during during the late 90s I think Gary actually was very useful or a while you're unquestionably one of the greatest so the classical rapid and Blitz you're one of the best people for many years in the world okay but you're currently number one Blitz it was sad to see Federer retire I don't know why yeah just greatness in a wooden Lionel Messi will retire it'll also be sad because there's certain people there um there's going to be another Federer yeah not for a long time is the greatest ever would you say is he up there he's definitely up there I mean I I grew up as like more of an adult fan just um I think Federer he changed the game I don't know if he says the greatest ever but the game changed forever because of him yeah there's certain people she said lasting impact Sampras uh Agassi meet so many people who are playing this great game from all different nationalities all all different backgrounds is is probably the thing that I I really like the most chess is little bit more like political but I think one of the things that's great is whenever you go and play these tournaments you have a certain impression of what a country is like or different than how the media will portray it one of my great regrets is as someone who loves history not going to see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa someone who loves history not going to see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times and of course no longer exists so I really do regret that see Magnus lepta which were the greatest ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times and of course no longer exists so I really do regret that I think another thing that's very unique about these things like thermopyla or Marathon these these great ancient battles um I don't know if there's like a specific like quote or wording or something like that that I can come up world champions they think that they're great no matter what they do um and that's not not like intentionally trying to be like be like rude but I do feel like there's certain people who and that leads to them becoming like a great scientist or something down the road that is what I'm what I'm ultimately hoping uh that's that's what I hope will come out of it I mean we'll fortunate travel the world meet people I've lived a great life so for me to see myself as a streamer doing so well and and bringing joy to people I don't feel like I'm in a think they still they still do some of these great Course and there was this I don't remember who who the guy was but he was a professor and so I watched some of these DVDs of his lectures and he does not appeal to me at all I I think one of another great thing about Chess is that within the Chess World I'm very prominent and famous but I can go out to the supermarket and nobody recognize me Love Is Love is uh I mean I think it can be the greatest thing in the world I think when it you know when When Things Fall Apart like you know I I've I've been through this like or any competition it can be the greatest thing in the world it can also be the worst thing in the world when when you're in love a lot of chess players for many it does not help them \\nLexBot:
