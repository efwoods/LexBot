## A tribute to the life and work of Lex Fridman.
Inspired by the life and work of Lex Fridman's podcast, you will find here a compendium of AI works based off of his likeness. The purpose of this repository is to serve as tribute, show respect for, and have a bit of fun immortalizing the eloquent yet questionably-human, Lex Fridman. 

Should by some rare chance this is viewed by him, Lex Fridman should know that I give full rights and control over the full lifecycle of this data and any works which may spring tangent off it. The life was yours, and this work should reflect your life as you see fit.
